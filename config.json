	How much to squish images by :

	The optimization level 0 enables a set of optimization operations that require minimal effort.
	There will be no changes to image attributes like bit depth or color type, and no recompression of existing IDAT datastreams.
	The optimization level 1 enables a single IDAT compression trial.
	The trial chosen is what. OptiPNG thinks it’s probably the most effective.
	The optimization levels 2 and higher enable multiple IDAT compression trials; the higher the level, the more trials.

	How much Javscript wrangling is acceptable?

	  --source-map                  Specify an output file where to generate source
									map.
	  --source-map-root             The path to the original source to be included
									in the source map.
	  --source-map-url              The path to the source map to be added in //#
									sourceMappingURL.  Defaults to the value passed
									with --source-map.
	  --source-map-include-sources  Pass this flag if you want to include the
									content of source files in the source map as
									sourcesContent property.
	  --in-source-map               Input source map, useful if you're compressing
									JS that was generated from some other original
									code.
	  --screw-ie8                   Pass this flag if you don't care about full
									compliance with Internet Explorer 6-8 quirks
									(by default UglifyJS will try to be IE-proof).
	  --expr                        Parse a single expression, rather than a
									program (for parsing JSON)
	  -p, --prefix                  Skip prefix for original filenames that appear
									in source maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3
									directories from file names and ensure they are
									relative paths. You can also specify -p
									relative, which will make UglifyJS figure out
									itself the relative paths between original
									sources, the source map and the output file.
	  -o, --output                  Output file (default STDOUT).
	  -b, --beautify                Beautify output/specify output options.
	  -m, --mangle                  Mangle names/pass mangler options.
	  -r, --reserved                Reserved names to exclude from mangling.
	  -c, --compress                Enable compressor/pass compressor options. Pass
									options like -c
									hoist_vars=false,if_return=false. Use -c with
									no argument to use the default compression
									options.
	  -d, --define                  Global definitions
	  -e, --enclose                 Embed everything in a big function, with a
									configurable parameter/argument list.
	  --comments                    Preserve copyright comments in the output. By
									default this works like Google Closure, keeping
									JSDoc-style comments that contain "@license" or
									"@preserve". You can optionally pass one of the
									following arguments to this flag:
									- "all" to keep all comments
									- a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a
									slash) to keep only comments that match.
									Note that currently not *all* comments can be
									kept when compression is on, because of dead
									code removal or cascading statements into
									sequences.
	  --preamble                    Preamble to prepend to the output.  You can use
									this to insert a comment, for example for
									licensing information.  This will not be
									parsed, but the source map will adjust for its
									presence.
	  --stats                       Display operations run time on STDERR.
	  --acorn                       Use Acorn for parsing.
	  --spidermonkey                Assume input files are SpiderMonkey AST format
									(as JSON).
	  --self                        Build itself (UglifyJS2) as a library (implies
									--wrap=UglifyJS --export-all)
	  --wrap                        Embed everything in a big function, making the
									“exports” and “global” variables available. You
									need to pass an argument to this option to
									specify the name that your module will take
									when included in, say, a browser.
	  --export-all                  Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to
									add code to automatically export all globals.
	  --lint                        Display some scope warnings
	  -v, --verbose                 Verbose
	  -V, --version                 Print version number and exit.
	  --noerr                       Don't throw an error for unknown options in -c,
									-b or -m.
	  --bare-returns                Allow return outside of functions.  Useful when
									minifying CommonJS modules.
	  --keep-fnames                 Do not mangle/drop function names.  Useful for
									code relying on Function.prototype.name.
	  --reserved-file               File containing reserved names
	  --reserve-domprops            Make (most?) DOM properties reserved for
									--mangle-props
	  --mangle-props                Mangle property names
	  --mangle-regex                Only mangle property names matching the regex
	  --name-cache                  File to hold mangled names mappings
